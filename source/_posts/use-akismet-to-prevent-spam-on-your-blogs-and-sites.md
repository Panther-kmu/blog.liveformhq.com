You can wire up LiveForm to use Akismet to prevent spam on your blogs and sites easily.

 1. Get an Akismet key by signing up on [Akismet](https://akismet.com/).
 2. Once, you have a key set it up on LiveForm by browsing to the form's Akismet tab and pasting your Akismet key.

That's all folks. Once you do this, all your form submissions will be checked for spam using Akismet!
