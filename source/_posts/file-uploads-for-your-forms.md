You can now do file uploads using Liveform. You just need two things to be able
to upload files.

 1. Make sure your form has an attribute `enctype="multipart/form-data"`
 2. Add a file field e.g. `<input type=file name=resume />`

That's it, once you have those, files can be uploaded through your forms.
