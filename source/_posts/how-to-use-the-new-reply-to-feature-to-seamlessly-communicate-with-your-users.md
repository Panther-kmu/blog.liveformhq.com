We have released a new feature which allows you to seamlessly communicate with your users. We love dogfooding and use LiveForm for our contact forms.
We get a lot of messages and it becomes tedious to create a new email and copy the recipient address to a new email and then respond.
We have been using this feature for a while and are making it public now. To use this feature just do the following:

  1. Add an email field to your contact form, you may already have this field. Copy the `name` of this input field from your contact form.
  2. Go to the 'Repy To' tab for your form and set the `reply_to` value to the name from step (1)

That is it, now when you get a notification email for your contact form. Just hit 'Reply' and continue the conversation.
